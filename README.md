# NuCivic DKAN Workflow

Workflow implementation for [DKAN](https://github.com/NuCivic/dkan) based on
[Workflow](https://www.drupal.org/project/workflow) and related modules.

## Requirements

This module needs to be [built using drush
make](https://github.com/NuCivic/nucivic-process/wiki/Using-drush-make-in-individual-modules)
before being enabled. If you only use "drush download" you will miss key
dependencies for required modules and libraries.

any questions in the mean time.
